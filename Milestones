Here’s a tight plan to take AirCanvas from concept → demo → delightful.

AirCanvas — Milestones

1) System sketch (single-camera pipeline)
2) MVP scope (first build)
3) Gesture design (robust & debounced)
4) Brush engine (feels good to draw)
5) Shape Snap (optional, delightful)
6) UI/UX interactions
7) Recording & export
8) Performance checklist
9) Face-triggered UI (fun extra)
10) Game & Kids modes (stretch)
11) Risks & mitigations
12) Test plan (quick & real)

Feature roadmap (no dates, just order)

1. Webcam + MediaPipe + draw with index (paused toggle via palm).
2. Add V / three-fingers cycling + HUD.
3. Clear (circle) + save (thumbs-up).
4. Undo/redo (swipes) + stroke stacks.
5. Brush styles + highlighter.
6. Radial palette + pinch select.
7. Timelapse recorder + MP4 export. (do we need at this point of time!!??)
8. Shape snap + face-triggered UI.
9. Kids & Game modes.
